This is a compiler implemented for the MJ language or mjlang, converts mjlang to python
A file written in mjlang should end in .mj
It is a triubute, to the King of Pop, well if anything.
It is mainly inspired from the language brainfuck.
Umm, the error handling is very naive as of now.

But currently it has neither a loop construct nor conditional
statements, neither any literals which will be added on later on.

The keywords and operators set are very small, but not necessarlily
short and concise.
Would love to hear from other MJ fans, whether this idea, is dumpshit, or can be improved!
Keep loving!!
